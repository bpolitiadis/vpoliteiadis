# Building the Casa Capoeira Portal: A Solo Dev’s Journey Into Code, Culture, and Craft

When I first sat down to start the Casa Capoeira Portal, I wasn’t thinking about buzzwords like “scalable architecture” or “role-based access control.” I was thinking about Mestre Ligeirinho, our community, and the countless Capoeira events, stories, and moments that deserved a proper home on the web.

But building that home — alone — meant wearing every hat imaginable:
Product manager. Designer. Architect. Backend engineer. Frontend developer. QA tester. Sysadmin. And yes, even CMS architect.

This is the story of how I built a production-ready, multilingual CMS platform for a global Capoeira community, entirely on my own — and what I learned along the way.

## Why This Project Needed to Exist

Capoeira is more than movement — it’s history, philosophy, music, and community. And yet, most Capoeira groups still rely on scattered Facebook posts, outdated websites, and word-of-mouth to share events and news.

I wanted to create something better:

- A central, multilingual hub for events, posts, and media.
- A system that could scale from a local group to an international audience.
- A platform that respects Capoeira’s traditions but also meets modern UX and technical standards.

I knew from day one this wouldn’t just be a “website.” It would be a custom CMS, tailored for the rhythms and workflows of Capoeira.

## The Technology Stack — and Why I Chose It

The stack had to be modern, maintainable, and future-proof without introducing unnecessary complexity.

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 18.3 (Server Components by default).
  - **Why**: Server-first rendering for performance, SEO, and cleaner data fetching.
- **Database & Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage) with Prisma ORM.
  - **Why**: SQL reliability + Prisma’s type safety + Supabase’s storage for media.
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v5 (JWT-based sessions).
  - **Why**: Flexible, secure, and well-documented for role-based control.
- **UI**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI + Radix Primitives.
  - **Why**: Consistent design system, accessibility built-in, rapid iteration.
- **Validation**: Zod on both frontend and backend.
  - **Why**: Single source of truth for input rules.
- **Email**: Resend API with React Email templates.
  - **Why**: Customizable transactional emails in multiple languages.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright for unit, API, and E2E.
  - **Why**: Confidence in core flows (especially event registration).
- **CMS Platform**: Custom-built admin panel at `/admin` with role-based access.
  - **Why**: Off-the-shelf CMSs (WordPress, Strapi) couldn’t match the tailored i18n and event/media workflows we needed.

This wasn’t just “the tech I like” — each choice was deliberate to balance performance, maintainability, and cultural requirements.

## The CMS: Where the Magic Happens

The public site might be the face of the Portal, but the real heart is the custom CMS I built for the teaching team.

### Core CMS Features

- **Events Manager**: Create, edit, publish/unpublish events; configure registration options; upload cover images; attach albums.
- **Posts Manager**: Rich text editor (TipTap) with embedded media, multilingual content creation, and tags.
- **Media Manager**: Batch uploads, drag-and-drop, cover selection, metadata editing, and event/post association.
- **Newsletter Manager**: Subscriber database, campaign creation, analytics.
- **User & Role Management**: Invite-only access, ADMIN/MODERATOR roles.

### What Makes It Different

- **Progressive Translation UI**: English content is required, other languages are optional and can be added gradually — perfect for a small admin team.
- **Cultural Alignment**: The forms, terminology, and data structures are tailored to how Capoeira events actually work (multi-day attendance, T-shirts, meals, etc.).
- **Role-based Safety**: The wrong person can’t accidentally wipe out all event data.

I wasn’t just building a “back office” — I was crafting an instrument that mestres and moderators could actually enjoy playing.

## The Hardest Challenges (and How I Solved Them)

### 1. True Multilingual Architecturei18n

The i18n requirements went far beyond a few translated strings.
Every piece of content — events, posts, albums — needed:

- A default (English) version.
- Optional translations in 3 more languages.
- Automatic fallback to the best available language.

The trap: Most CMSs store translations inline, which quickly gets messy.

**My solution:**
Separate translation tables in the database (EventTranslation, PostTranslation, MediaAlbumTranslation) with unique constraints and a clean resolution function. This keeps queries fast and fallback logic consistent.

### 2. Media Uploads Without Painmedia

Events without photos feel incomplete. But uploading and organizing media can be a nightmare for non-technical users.

The trap: Upload workflows that block content creation until every file is perfect.

**My solution:**

- Immediate cover image upload with preview.
- Batch media uploads after album creation, with progress bars and error feedback.
- Supabase Storage with strict RLS policies to keep public and private media separate.

### 3. Event Registration Logic That Adaptsevents

Capoeira events can be wildly different — a one-day kids’ workshop, a week-long international festival, or anything in between.

The trap: Hardcoding a “one-size-fits-all” registration form.

**My solution:**

- Dynamic form generation based on event config.
- Conditional Zod validation that changes per event.
- Built-in constraints like one registration per email per event.

### 4. Building Alone Means Owning Everything

Every bug, every deployment, every database migration — it’s all on me.

This meant:

- Writing tests before features for critical flows.
- Keeping strict commit discipline (small, meaningful commits with clear messages).
- Automating backups so I could sleep at night.
- Documenting every decision in `/docs/` so future contributors (or future me) wouldn’t be lost.

## Security and Ops: My Invisible Work

Users never see it, but a lot of my time went into:

- Middleware that protects admin routes and enforces rolesauth.
- Rate-limiting public forms to prevent spam.
- Structured logging with context for every requestoperations.
- Blue-green deployment so updates happen without downtime.
- Daily database backups + weekly media backups with encryption.

## Reflections as a Solo Developer

Building this was both exhilarating and exhausting.
There were nights where I stared at Prisma migration errors for hours. Days spent debugging why a Supabase storage policy wasn’t behaving. And the endless balancing act between what’s perfect and what ships.

But when I saw the first public user register for an event in Greek, get their confirmation email in Portuguese, and browse an event gallery in German — it hit me:
This wasn’t just a website. It was a living, breathing digital roda.

## Final Thoughts

The Casa Capoeira Portal is now live, fast, secure, multilingual, and easy to use — for both our community and the small admin team that keeps it running.

As a solo developer, this project taught me how to:

- Balance cultural authenticity with technical excellence.
- Build a custom CMS that fits a niche better than any off-the-shelf option.
- Manage scope, performance, and security without a safety net.

And most importantly — that building software for a community you love is the most rewarding work there is.
