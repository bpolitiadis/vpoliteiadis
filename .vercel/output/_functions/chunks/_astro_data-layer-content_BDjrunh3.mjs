What started as an obscure experiment in 2009 has now transformed into a global movement—reshaping how we think about money, trust, and freedom.\n\nBut Bitcoin is more than just a price chart or an investment. It's the culmination of centuries of evolution in how humans store and exchange value, combined with the philosophy of decentralization—a belief that no single entity should control our money.\n\n---\n\n## The Origins: A Brief History of Money\n\nBefore we can understand Bitcoin, we must understand the history it seeks to disrupt.\n\n1. **Barter System** – The earliest form of trade, where goods and services were directly exchanged. Inefficient and limited.\n2. **Commodity Money** – Precious metals like gold and silver became a medium of exchange, valued for their scarcity.\n3. **Paper Money** – Governments began issuing currency backed by gold, then later by nothing more than trust.\n4. **Fiat Currency Era** – The modern system, where money is created by central banks, backed by government decree, and vulnerable to inflation.\n\nFor centuries, control over money has been centralized—whether by kings, banks, or governments.\n\n---\n\n## The Philosophy: Why Decentralization Matters\n\nBitcoin challenges this central control with one radical idea: **money should be owned and controlled by the people, not by governments or corporations.**\n\n- **Freedom from Censorship** – No government or bank can freeze your Bitcoin.\n- **Global Accessibility** – Anyone with an internet connection can participate.\n- **Fixed Supply** – Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, protecting against inflation.\n- **Trust in Code, Not in Institutions** – Bitcoin runs on transparent, open-source code.\n\nDecentralization is not just a technical choice—it's a moral and political statement about human sovereignty.\n\n---\n\n## The Birth of Bitcoin: Satoshi Nakamoto's Vision\n\nIn 2008, amid the global financial crisis, an anonymous figure (or group) named **Satoshi Nakamoto** published the **Bitcoin Whitepaper**. The paper described a peer-to-peer electronic cash system—digital money without the need for banks.\n\nOn **January 3, 2009**, Satoshi mined the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, embedding a hidden message:\n\n> *\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\"*\n\nIt was both a timestamp and a political statement about the instability of centralized finance.\n\nSatoshi disappeared in 2011, leaving the project to the community. To this day, their identity remains unknown.\n\n---\n\n## The Blockchain: Bitcoin's Engine\n\nAt the heart of Bitcoin is the **blockchain**—a public, decentralized ledger that records every transaction ever made.\n\n- **Blocks** – Groups of transactions.\n- **Miners** – Computers solving cryptographic puzzles to add blocks.\n- **Proof of Work** – The consensus mechanism ensuring security.\n\nOnce a block is added, it cannot be altered—making Bitcoin nearly impossible to hack.\n\n---\n\n## The Bitcoin Community: From Cypherpunks to Wall Street\n\nBitcoin's early adopters were **cypherpunks**—privacy advocates, libertarians, and tech enthusiasts who saw it as a way to escape the traditional banking system.\n\n- **2010** – The first known commercial transaction: 10,000 BTC for two pizzas.\n- **2013-2017** – Waves of adoption, media attention, and regulatory debates.\n- **2020-2021** – Institutions and public companies start buying Bitcoin.\n- **2022-2025** – Nations explore Bitcoin as legal tender; investment funds treat it as a core asset.\n\nToday, Bitcoin's community spans everyone from individual hodlers to billion-dollar corporations.\n\n---\n\n## Price History: The Volatile Climb\n\nBitcoin's journey is one of the most dramatic in financial history:\n\n- **2010** – &lt;$0.01\n- **2013** – $1,000\n- **2017** – $20,000\n- **2021** – $69,000 (previous all-time high)\n- **2022** – Crash to ~$16,000 during global economic uncertainty.\n- **2023-2025** – Renewed bull run, driven by scarcity, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic shifts.\n- **Today (Aug 9, 2025)** – **$116,500**\n\n---\n\n## Why Bitcoin Matters Today\n\nWe live in an age of:\n\n- **Rising Inflation** – Eroding purchasing power.\n- **Banking Restrictions** – Freezing of funds, capital controls.\n- **Digital Surveillance** – Governments tracking financial activity.\n\nBitcoin offers an alternative: a decentralized, borderless, censorship-resistant form of money.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Future is Decentralized\n\nBitcoin is not just a financial asset—it's a philosophical shift. It challenges the monopoly of money, empowers individuals, and lays the foundation for a new, open financial system.\n\nWhether it's worth $10,000 or $1 million, Bitcoin's real value lies in its promise: **freedom through decentralization**.\n\n---\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\n> The best way to understand Bitcoin is to experience it.

Designer. Architect. Backend engineer. Frontend developer. QA tester. Sysadmin. And yes, even CMS architect.\n\nThis is the story of how I built a production-ready, multilingual CMS platform for a global Capoeira community, entirely on my own — and what I learned along the way.\n\n## Why This Project Needed to Exist\n\nCapoeira is more than movement — it’s history, philosophy, music, and community. And yet, most Capoeira groups still rely on scattered Facebook posts, outdated websites, and word-of-mouth to share events and news.\n\nI wanted to create something better:\n\n- A central, multilingual hub for events, posts, and media.\n- A system that could scale from a local group to an international audience.\n- A platform that respects Capoeira’s traditions but also meets modern UX and technical standards.\n\nI knew from day one this wouldn’t just be a “website.” It would be a custom CMS, tailored for the rhythms and workflows of Capoeira.\n\n## The Technology Stack — and Why I Chose It\n\nThe stack had to be modern, maintainable, and future-proof without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 18.3 (Server Components by default).\n  - **Why**: Server-first rendering for performance, SEO, and cleaner data fetching.\n- **Database & Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage) with Prisma ORM.\n  - **Why**: SQL reliability + Prisma’s type safety + Supabase’s storage for media.\n- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v5 (JWT-based sessions).\n  - **Why**: Flexible, secure, and well-documented for role-based control.\n- **UI**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI + Radix Primitives.\n  - **Why**: Consistent design system, accessibility built-in, rapid iteration.\n- **Validation**: Zod on both frontend and backend.\n  - **Why**: Single source of truth for input rules.\n- **Email**: Resend API with React Email templates.\n  - **Why**: Customizable transactional emails in multiple languages.\n- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright for unit, API, and E2E.\n  - **Why**: Confidence in core flows (especially event registration).\n- **CMS Platform**: Custom-built admin panel at `/admin` with role-based access.\n  - **Why**: Off-the-shelf CMSs (WordPress, Strapi) couldn’t match the tailored i18n and event/media workflows we needed.\n\nThis wasn’t just “the tech I like” — each choice was deliberate to balance performance, maintainability, and cultural requirements.\n\n## The CMS: Where the Magic Happens\n\nThe public site might be the face of the Portal, but the real heart is the custom CMS I built for the teaching team.\n\n### Core CMS Features\n\n- **Events Manager**: Create, edit, publish/unpublish events; configure registration options; upload cover images; attach albums.\n- **Posts Manager**: Rich text editor (TipTap) with embedded media, multilingual content creation, and tags.\n- **Media Manager**: Batch uploads, drag-and-drop, cover selection, metadata editing, and event/post association.\n- **Newsletter Manager**: Subscriber database, campaign creation, analytics.\n- **User & Role Management**: Invite-only access, ADMIN/MODERATOR roles.\n\n### What Makes It Different\n\n- **Progressive Translation UI**: English content is required, other languages are optional and can be added gradually — perfect for a small admin team.\n- **Cultural Alignment**: The forms, terminology, and data structures are tailored to how Capoeira events actually work (multi-day attendance, T-shirts, meals, etc.).\n- **Role-based Safety**: The wrong person can’t accidentally wipe out all event data.\n\nI wasn’t just building a “back office” — I was crafting an instrument that mestres and moderators could actually enjoy playing.\n\n## The Hardest Challenges (and How I Solved Them)\n\n### 1. True Multilingual Architecturei18n\n\nThe i18n requirements went far beyond a few translated strings.\nEvery piece of content — events, posts, albums — needed:\n\n- A default (English) version.\n- Optional translations in 3 more languages.\n- Automatic fallback to the best available language.\n\nThe trap: Most CMSs store translations inline, which quickly gets messy.\n\n**My solution:**\nSeparate translation tables in the database (EventTranslation, PostTranslation, MediaAlbumTranslation) with unique constraints and a clean resolution function. This keeps queries fast and fallback logic consistent.\n\n### 2. Media Uploads Without Painmedia\n\nEvents without photos feel incomplete. But uploading and organizing media can be a nightmare for non-technical users.\n\nThe trap: Upload workflows that block content creation until every file is perfect.\n\n**My solution:**\n\n- Immediate cover image upload with preview.\n- Batch media uploads after album creation, with progress bars and error feedback.\n- Supabase Storage with strict RLS policies to keep public and private media separate.\n\n### 3. Event Registration Logic That Adaptsevents\n\nCapoeira events can be wildly different — a one-day kids’ workshop, a week-long international festival, or anything in between.\n\nThe trap: Hardcoding a “one-size-fits-all” registration form.\n\n**My solution:**\n\n- Dynamic form generation based on event config.\n- Conditional Zod validation that changes per event.\n- Built-in constraints like one registration per email per event.\n\n### 4. Building Alone Means Owning Everything\n\nEvery bug, every deployment, every database migration — it’s all on me.\n\nThis meant:\n\n- Writing tests before features for critical flows.\n- Keeping strict commit discipline (small, meaningful commits with clear messages).\n- Automating backups so I could sleep at night.\n- Documenting every decision in `/docs/` so future contributors (or future me) wouldn’t be lost.\n\n## Security and Ops: My Invisible Work\n\nUsers never see it, but a lot of my time went into:\n\n- Middleware that protects admin routes and enforces rolesauth.\n- Rate-limiting public forms to prevent spam.\n- Structured logging with context for every requestoperations.\n- Blue-green deployment so updates happen without downtime.\n- Daily database backups + weekly media backups with encryption.\n\n## Reflections as a Solo Developer\n\nBuilding this was both exhilarating and exhausting.\nThere were nights where I stared at Prisma migration errors for hours. Days spent debugging why a Supabase storage policy wasn’t behaving. And the endless balancing act between what’s perfect and what ships.\n\nBut when I saw the first public user register for an event in Greek, get their confirmation email in Portuguese, and browse an event gallery in German — it hit me:\nThis wasn’t just a website. It was a living, breathing digital roda.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe Casa Capoeira Portal is now live, fast, secure, multilingual, and easy to use — for both our community and the small admin team that keeps it running.\n\nAs a solo developer, this project taught me how to:\n\n- Balance cultural authenticity with technical excellence.\n- Build a custom CMS that fits a niche better than any off-the-shelf option.\n- Manage scope, performance, and security without a safety net.\n\nAnd most importantly — that building software for a community you love is the most rewarding work there is.","src/content/blog/casa-capoeira-journey.mdx","13d2bab2ec6aa513","casa-capoeira-journey.mdx","prompt-engineering-mastery",{id:82,data:84,body:106,filePath:107,digest:108,legacyId:109,deferredRender:43},{title:85,description:86,excerpt:87,coverImage:88,author:18,tags:89,category:95,featured:43,publishedAt:28,readingTime:96,draft:27,seo:97},"Prompt Engineering Mastery: Advanced Techniques, Templates, and the Future of Context Engineering","Prompt engineering is the new programming language.

In the AI world, that line is your prompt._\n\nMost people using ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini are only scratching the surface. They type a question, hit enter, and accept whatever comes back — often missing out on **precision, depth, and creativity**.\n\nBut here’s the truth: **prompt engineering is the new programming language**. And when you combine it with **context engineering**, you unlock the ability to **shape AI output with surgical precision**.\n\n---\n\n## Why Prompt Engineering Matters\n\nA prompt is not “just a question.” It’s a **set of instructions, constraints, and context** that guide an AI’s reasoning process. Think of it as writing a **specification document** for an AI developer who works at the speed of light.\n\nWithout prompt engineering:\n- You get vague, generic responses.\n- You spend time rewriting and re-asking.\n- Your AI becomes unpredictable.\n\nWith **advanced prompt engineering**:\n- You **control tone, format, and scope**.\n- You get **consistent, high-quality results**.\n- You can chain outputs into **repeatable workflows**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Evolution of Prompt Engineering\n\nWe started with **simple Q&A prompts**:\n\n> “What’s the capital of France?”\n\nThen moved to **structured instructions**:\n\n> “Act as a travel guide. Recommend 5 must-visit spots in Paris for a solo traveler who loves art and history.”\n\nNow, we’re in the **multi-layered, context-rich era**:\n- Assign roles\n- Provide examples\n- Define output format\n- Include constraints\n- Inject relevant context dynamically\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Principles of Advanced Prompting\n\n### A. Role Assignment\nThe AI takes on an **identity** with domain expertise.\n\n```plaintext\nYou are a senior QA Automation Engineer specializing in Playwright and TypeScript...\n```\n\nWhy it works: it sets **knowledge scope** and **output expectations** from the start.\n\n---\n\n### B. Layered Instructions\n\nStructure your prompt in **sections**:\n\n1. Role/Identity\n2. Task description\n3. Constraints\n4. Output format\n\n---\n\n### C. Constraint-Based Output\n\nTell the AI exactly what you want — formats, length, tone, or tech stack.\n\n```plaintext\nOutput in Markdown format with code blocks for each example.\n```\n\n---\n\n### D. Test and Iterate\n\nTreat prompts like **source code**: debug, refine, and version them.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Context Engineering: The Power Behind the Prompt\n\n**Context engineering** is the art of shaping all the information the AI sees before answering.\n\nWhy it’s powerful:\n\n- Reduces **hallucinations**\n- Improves **accuracy**\n- Maintains **stylistic consistency**\n\n### Techniques\n\n- **Memory Injection**: Feed relevant history from earlier prompts.\n- **Progressive Context Building**: Start small, expand with focused follow-ups.\n- **Example-Driven Steering**: Show the AI the type of output you want.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Advanced Prompt Patterns (Templates)\n\nHere are **Matrix‑optimized** prompt templates for different professional use cases.\n\n### A. QA Automation Code Generator\n\n```plaintext\nYou are a senior QA Automation Engineer specializing in Playwright (TypeScript).\nGenerate an end-to-end test script for [APP NAME], testing:\n1. User login with valid and invalid credentials\n2. Page navigation after login\n3. API response validation for [API ENDPOINT]\nFollow best practices:\n- Page Object Model\n- Comments for each step\n- Async/await syntax\nReturn clean, runnable code.\n```\n\n### B. Full-Stack Feature Blueprint\n\n```plaintext\nYou are a senior full-stack developer (Next.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL).\nDesign a feature for a [PROJECT TYPE].\nDeliverables:\n- ERD diagram description\n- API endpoint structure\n- Component hierarchy\n- Example TailwindCSS styles\nOutput in Markdown format.\n```\n\n### C. Creative AI Image Prompt\n\n```plaintext\nYou are an AI art director with a Matrix-inspired, cyberpunk aesthetic.\nGenerate 5 Midjourney prompts for surreal cityscapes:\n- No text, logos, or watermarks\n- 16:9 ratio\n- Neon green & black palette\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Debugging Your Prompts\n\nIf the AI output is off:\n\n1. **Split the task** into smaller steps.\n2. Use “think step-by-step” to improve reasoning.\n3. Feed **previous outputs** back into the next prompt for refinement.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Being vague**: “Write me some tests” → Output too generic.\n- **Overloading details**: Irrelevant instructions can confuse the AI.\n- **Ignoring model differences**: What works in ChatGPT may differ in Claude or Gemini.\n\n---\n\n## 7. A Glimpse at Vibe Coding (Teaser)\n\n**Vibe Coding** is an emerging approach where **aesthetic and emotional tone** influence AI outputs. It’s about how you speak to the AI, not just what you ask. We’ll cover this in depth in a future article.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPrompt Engineering is **coding for AI minds**. Context Engineering is the **architecture layer** that makes it scalable and repeatable. Master both, and you can bend AI output to your will.\n\n> Next time you type a prompt, treat it like production code: test it. Refine it. Version it. Watch your AI become your most reliable collaborator.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 What’s the most powerful prompt you’ve ever written?\n\nDrop it in the comments — let’s build the **Ultimate Prompt Library** together.","src/content/blog/prompt-engineering-mastery.mdx","8d51ba9d2d60f9c5","prompt-engineering-mastery.mdx","projects",["Map",112,113,213,214],"casa-capoeira",{id:112,data:114,body:169,filePath:170,digest:171,rendered:172,legacyId:212},{title:115,description:116,excerpt:117,coverImage:118,coverVideo:119,tags:120,techStack:125,featured:43,publishedAt:134,updatedAt:135,client:136,duration:137,role:138,team:139,problem:140,solution:141,impact:142,challenges:143,learnings:148,liveUrl:153,githubUrl:154,status:155,featuredImage:156,gallery:157,roleSummary:158,highlights:159,about:163,roleDetails:164,roleHighlights:165},"Casa Capoeira","Focused CMS for capoeira academies with scheduling, enrollment, payments, and community.","Designed the domain model and shipped a fast, reliable CMS for capoeira schools.","/images/projects/casa-capoeira-cover.png","/videos/casa-capoeira-preview.mp4",[66,121,122,123,124],"Education","Community","Full-Stack","SaaS",[126,127,128,129,130,131,58,132,133,61,62,63,64],"Next.js 15","React 18","TypeScript","Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)","Prisma ORM","NextAuth v5","ShadCN UI","Radix Primitives","2025-08-01","2025-08-02","Capoeira Community","6 months","Full-Stack Developer + Product Designer",[18],"Capoeira schools struggle with manual class scheduling, student management, and community engagement.
