# Upiria - Startup Frontend Development & Testing

## The Challenge

Upiria, a fast-growing startup, needed to rapidly develop and deploy front-end features while maintaining high code quality and reliability. The team was moving fast but needed a solid testing foundation to prevent regressions.

## The Solution

I joined the team to focus on front-end development and establish comprehensive testing practices. This involved building React components, implementing automated testing, and setting up CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Contributions

- **React Component Development**: Built reusable, accessible components following modern React patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Implemented Playwright for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit testing
- **TypeScript Integration**: Migrated JavaScript codebase to TypeScript for better type safety
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing in GitHub Actions for every pull request
- **Documentation**: Created testing guidelines and component documentation

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Jest + Testing Library for unit tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing
- **State Management**: React Context + custom hooks
- **Styling**: CSS Modules with design system

## The Impact

The testing infrastructure and development practices I implemented had significant impact:

- **60% reduction** in bug reports from production
- **40% improvement** in development velocity
- **100% test coverage** for critical user flows
- **Established best practices** that continue to benefit the team

## Key Learnings

Working at a startup taught me valuable lessons about balancing speed and quality:

- **Testing-first approach** pays dividends even in fast-moving environments
- **TypeScript** significantly reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience
- **Automated testing** enables confident deployments and rapid iteration
- **Documentation** is crucial for team scaling and knowledge transfer

## Looking Back

The experience at Upiria reinforced my belief in the importance of solid engineering practices, even in fast-paced startup environments. The testing infrastructure and development patterns established continue to serve the team well.

_Startup environments require a unique balance of speed and quality - this project demonstrated how proper testing infrastructure enables both._
