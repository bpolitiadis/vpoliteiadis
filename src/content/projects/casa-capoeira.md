# Casa Capoeira - Revolutionizing Capoeira School Management

## The Challenge

Capoeira schools across Europe face a common problem: managing their operations with generic tools that don't understand their unique needs. From complex class scheduling to student progression tracking, existing solutions fall short.

- **Multi-language Support**: Available in Portuguese, English, and Spanish

### Technical Architecture

Built with modern technologies for scalability and performance:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router, Server Components) with React 18 and TypeScript
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v5 (JWT-based sessions)
- **Backend**: Next.js Route Handlers with Prisma ORM
- **Database & Storage**: PostgreSQL via Supabase + Supabase Storage for media
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with ShadCN UI and Radix Primitives
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation across client and server
- **Email**: Resend with React Email templates
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
