As someone who balances technical engineering with creative pursuits, I've witnessed firsthand how AI tools are transforming not just the creative process, but our very understanding of what it means to be creative.\n\n## The Evolution of Creative Tools\n\nTraditional creative workflows have always been limited by technical skill, time, and resources. Learning to paint, compose music, or design requires years of practice and dedication. But AI is democratizing creativity in unprecedented ways.\n\n### From Manual to Assisted Creation\n\nConsider the journey from traditional painting to digital art:\n\n```typescript\n// Traditional workflow\nconst traditionalProcess = {\n  skill: 'Years of practice required',\n  materials: 'Expensive supplies',\n  time: 'Weeks to months per piece',\n  accessibility: 'Limited to skilled artists',\n};\n\n// AI-assisted workflow\nconst aiProcess = {\n  skill: 'Basic prompt engineering',\n  materials: 'Subscription to AI tools',\n  time: 'Minutes to hours per piece',\n  accessibility: 'Open to anyone with imagination',\n};\n```\n\n## My Experience with AI Art\n\nThrough my Instagram account [@arte.imaginari](https://instagram.com/arte.imaginari), I've explored various AI tools and their creative potential. Here's what I've learned:\n\n### Midjourney: The Game Changer\n\nMidjourney has been revolutionary for my creative process. The ability to iterate quickly and explore concepts that would take weeks to sketch manually has opened new creative possibilities.\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n\n- Rapid prototyping and iteration\n- Exploration of impossible concepts\n- Consistent style development\n- Commercial viability\n\n### The Creative Process\n\nHere's my typical workflow when creating AI-assisted art:\n\n1. **Concept Development**: Start with a clear vision or emotion\n2. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft detailed, specific prompts\n3. **Iteration**: Generate multiple variations\n4. **Refinement**: Use inpainting and outpainting\n5. **Post-Processing**: Apply traditional editing techniques\n\n## Technical Integration\n\nAs a developer, I'm particularly interested in how AI tools can be integrated into existing workflows. Here's a simple example of how you might integrate AI image generation into a web application:\n\n```javascript\n// Example: AI-powered design system\nclass AIDesignSystem {\n  constructor(apiKey) {\n    this.apiKey = apiKey;\n    this.baseUrl = 'https://api.midjourney.com/v1';\n  }\n\n  async generateDesign(prompt, style = 'cyberpunk') {\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/imagine`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        prompt: `${prompt} --style ${style}`,\n        aspect_ratio: '16:9',\n        quality: 'high',\n      }),\n    });\n\n    return await response.json();\n  }\n\n  async createVariation(imageId, variation = 1) {\n    // Generate variations of existing images\n    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/variation`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        image_id: imageId,\n        variation: variation,\n      }),\n    });\n\n    return await response.json();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## The Human Element\n\nDespite the power of AI tools, the human element remains crucial. AI is a collaborator, not a replacement. The most successful AI-assisted creators understand:\n\n- **Vision**: Having a clear creative direction\n- **Curiosity**: Exploring new techniques and tools\n- **Iteration**: Being willing to refine and improve\n- **Authenticity**: Maintaining your unique voice\n\n## Commercial Applications\n\nAI-assisted creativity isn't just for hobbyists. I've successfully used these tools for:\n\n- **Album Covers**: Creating unique artwork for local musicians\n- **Event Posters**: Designing promotional materials for techno parties\n- **Fashion Design**: Developing silk scarf patterns for fashion brands\n\nThe commercial viability of AI art is growing rapidly, creating new opportunities for creative professionals.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nAs AI tools become more sophisticated, we need to consider:\n\n- **Copyright**: Who owns AI-generated content?\n- **Attribution**: How do we credit AI tools and human creators?\n- **Authenticity**: What makes art \"authentic\" in the AI age?\n- **Accessibility**: Ensuring these tools remain available to diverse creators\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThe future of AI-assisted creativity is incredibly promising. We're moving toward:\n\n- **Real-time Collaboration**: AI tools that respond to human input instantly\n- **Cross-medium Integration**: Seamless movement between text, image, and video\n- **Personalized AI**: Tools that learn and adapt to individual creative styles\n- **Democratized Creation**: Making professional-quality art accessible to everyone\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI-assisted creativity represents a fundamental shift in how we approach artistic expression. Rather than replacing human creativity, these tools amplify it, enabling us to explore ideas and concepts that were previously impossible or impractical.\n\nThe key is to approach AI as a collaborator—a powerful tool that enhances rather than replaces human imagination. As we continue to develop these technologies, the line between human and AI creativity will blur, creating new forms of artistic expression that we're only beginning to imagine.\n\n---\n\n_What are your thoughts on AI-assisted creativity?

This post shares the advanced strategies and techniques that have proven invaluable in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Why Playwright for Enterprise Applications?\n\nPlaywright has become my go-to tool for enterprise testing, especially for European Commission projects where reliability, performance, and cross-browser compatibility are non-negotiable.\n\n### Key Advantages for Enterprise\n\n```typescript\n// Playwright's enterprise advantages\nconst playwrightAdvantages = {\n  crossBrowser: 'Chromium, Firefox, WebKit support',\n  reliability: 'Auto-waiting and smart retry mechanisms',\n  performance: 'Parallel execution and resource optimization',\n  debugging: 'Trace viewer and video recording',\n  maintainability: 'TypeScript support and clean APIs',\n};\n```\n\n## Advanced Test Architecture\n\n### 1. Page Object Model with TypeScript\n\nHere's how I structure complex test suites for enterprise applications:\n\n```typescript\n// Base page object with common functionality\nabstract class BasePage {\n  protected page: Page;\n  protected baseUrl: string;\n\n  constructor(page: Page, baseUrl: string) {\n    this.page = page;\n    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;\n  }\n\n  // Common navigation method\n  async navigateTo(path: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.page.goto(`${this.baseUrl}${path}`);\n    await this.waitForPageLoad();\n  }\n\n  // Smart wait for page load\n  private async waitForPageLoad(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n    await this.page.waitForFunction(() => document.readyState === 'complete');\n  }\n\n  // Common assertion helper\n  protected async assertElementVisible(selector: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await expect(this.page.locator(selector)).toBeVisible();\n  }\n}\n\n// Specific page object for login\nclass LoginPage extends BasePage {\n  private readonly emailInput = '[data-testid=\"email-input\"]';\n  private readonly passwordInput = '[data-testid=\"password-input\"]';\n  private readonly loginButton = '[data-testid=\"login-button\"]';\n  private readonly errorMessage = '[data-testid=\"error-message\"]';\n\n  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.page.fill(this.emailInput, email);\n    await this.page.fill(this.passwordInput, password);\n    await this.page.click(this.loginButton);\n  }\n\n  async assertLoginError(expectedMessage: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.assertElementVisible(this.errorMessage);\n    await expect(this.page.locator(this.errorMessage)).toContainText(\n      expectedMessage\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Test Data Management\n\nFor European Commission projects, test data management is critical:\n\n```typescript\n// Test data factory with realistic data\nclass TestDataFactory {\n  static generateUserData(): UserData {\n    return {\n      email: `test.user.${Date.now()}@example.com`,\n      firstName: this.getRandomFirstName(),\n      lastName: this.getRandomLastName(),\n      organization: this.getRandomOrganization(),\n      role: this.getRandomRole(),\n    };\n  }\n\n  static generateCommissionData(): CommissionData {\n    return {\n      projectId: `EC-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9).toUpperCase()}`,\n      title: `Test Project ${Date.now()}`,\n      budget: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000) + 50000,\n      duration: Math.floor(Math.random() * 24) + 6,\n      priority: this.getRandomPriority(),\n    };\n  }\n\n  private static getRandomFirstName(): string {\n    const names = ['Maria', 'Giuseppe', 'Hans', 'Sophie', 'Pierre', 'Ana'];\n    return names[Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length)];\n  }\n\n  private static getRandomOrganization(): string {\n    const orgs = [\n      'European Commission',\n      'Member State Agency',\n      'Research Institute',\n    ];\n    return orgs[Math.floor(Math.random() * orgs.length)];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Testing Techniques\n\n### 1. Handling Dynamic Content\n\nEuropean Commission applications often have dynamic content that changes based on user roles and permissions:\n\n```typescript\n// Dynamic content testing strategy\nclass DynamicContentTester {\n  constructor(private page: Page) {}\n\n  async waitForDynamicContent(\n    selector: string,\n    timeout = 10000\n  ): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.page.waitForFunction(\n      sel => {\n        const element = document.querySelector(sel);\n        return (\n          element && element.textContent && element.textContent.trim() !== ''\n        );\n      },\n      selector,\n      { timeout }\n    );\n  }\n\n  async assertContentBasedOnRole(role: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    const roleSelectors = {\n      admin: '[data-role=\"admin\"]',\n      user: '[data-role=\"user\"]',\n      viewer: '[data-role=\"viewer\"]',\n    };\n\n    const selector = roleSelectors[role as keyof typeof roleSelectors];\n    if (selector) {\n      await this.page.waitForSelector(selector);\n      await expect(this.page.locator(selector)).toBeVisible();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. API Testing Integration\n\nCombining UI and API testing for comprehensive coverage:\n\n```typescript\n// API testing integration\nclass APITestHelper {\n  private context: APIRequestContext;\n\n  constructor(context: APIRequestContext) {\n    this.context = context;\n  }\n\n  async createTestUser(userData: UserData): Promise\u003CAPIResponse> {\n    return await this.context.post('/api/users', {\n      data: userData,\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  async cleanupTestData(userId: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.context.delete(`/api/users/${userId}`, {\n      headers: {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`,\n      },\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n// Combined UI and API test\ntest('user registration flow', async ({ page, request }) => {\n  const apiHelper = new APITestHelper(request);\n  const userData = TestDataFactory.generateUserData();\n\n  // Create user via API\n  const response = await apiHelper.createTestUser(userData);\n  expect(response.status()).toBe(201);\n\n  // Verify UI reflects the creation\n  await page.goto('/users');\n  await page.waitForSelector(`[data-user-id=\"${userData.email}\"]`);\n  await expect(\n    page.locator(`[data-user-id=\"${userData.email}\"]`)\n  ).toBeVisible();\n\n  // Cleanup\n  await apiHelper.cleanupTestData(userData.email);\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Performance Testing\n\nFor enterprise applications, performance is critical:\n\n```typescript\n// Performance testing utilities\nclass PerformanceTester {\n  constructor(private page: Page) {}\n\n  async measurePageLoadTime(): Promise\u003Cnumber> {\n    const startTime = Date.now();\n\n    await this.page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n    const loadTime = Date.now() - startTime;\n    console.log(`Page load time: ${loadTime}ms`);\n\n    return loadTime;\n  }\n\n  async assertPerformanceThreshold(maxLoadTime: number): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    const loadTime = await this.measurePageLoadTime();\n    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(maxLoadTime);\n  }\n\n  async monitorNetworkRequests(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    const requests: string[] = [];\n\n    this.page.on('request', request => {\n      requests.push(request.url());\n    });\n\n    await this.page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n    // Analyze requests for performance issues\n    const slowRequests = requests.filter(\n      url => url.includes('/api/') && !url.includes('/health')\n    );\n\n    console.log(`Network requests: ${requests.length}`);\n    console.log(`API calls: ${slowRequests.length}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling and Recovery\n\n### 1. Robust Error Handling\n\n```typescript\n// Advanced error handling for flaky tests\nclass RobustTestHelper {\n  constructor(private page: Page) {}\n\n  async clickWithRetry(selector: string, maxRetries = 3): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003C maxRetries; i++) {\n      try {\n        await this.page.click(selector);\n        return;\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;\n        await this.page.waitForTimeout(1000);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  async waitForElementWithTimeout(\n    selector: string,\n    timeout = 10000\n  ): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    try {\n      await this.page.waitForSelector(selector, { timeout });\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Take screenshot for debugging\n      await this.page.screenshot({ path: `error-${Date.now()}.png` });\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Test Recovery Strategies\n\n```typescript\n// Test recovery and cleanup\nclass TestRecovery {\n  static async cleanupTestEnvironment(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    // Clean up test data\n    // Reset application state\n    // Clear browser storage\n  }\n\n  static async handleTestFailure(page: Page, testName: string): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    // Take screenshot\n    await page.screenshot({\n      path: `failure-${testName}-${Date.now()}.png`,\n      fullPage: true,\n    });\n\n    // Save page HTML for debugging\n    const html = await page.content();\n    require('fs').writeFileSync(`failure-${testName}-${Date.now()}.html`, html);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration Management\n\n### 1. Environment-Specific Configurations\n\n```typescript\n// Configuration management for different environments\ninterface TestConfig {\n  baseUrl: string;\n  timeout: number;\n  retries: number;\n  headless: boolean;\n  slowMo: number;\n}\n\nclass ConfigManager {\n  static getConfig(environment: string): TestConfig {\n    const configs = {\n      local: {\n        baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',\n        timeout: 30000,\n        retries: 2,\n        headless: false,\n        slowMo: 1000,\n      },\n      staging: {\n        baseUrl: 'https://staging.ec-project.eu',\n        timeout: 60000,\n        retries: 3,\n        headless: true,\n        slowMo: 0,\n      },\n      production: {\n        baseUrl: 'https://ec-project.eu',\n        timeout: 90000,\n        retries: 1,\n        headless: true,\n        slowMo: 0,\n      },\n    };\n\n    return configs[environment as keyof typeof configs] || configs.local;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices from European Commission Projects\n\n### 1. Security Testing\n\n```typescript\n// Security testing utilities\nclass SecurityTester {\n  constructor(private page: Page) {}\n\n  async testXSSVulnerability(\n    inputSelector: string,\n    payload: string\n  ): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    await this.page.fill(inputSelector, payload);\n    await this.page.click('[type=\"submit\"]');\n\n    // Check if payload was executed\n    const alertHandled = await this.page.evaluate(() => {\n      return new Promise(resolve => {\n        window.alert = () => resolve(true);\n        setTimeout(() => resolve(false), 1000);\n      });\n    });\n\n    expect(alertHandled).toBe(false);\n  }\n\n  async testCSRFProtection(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    // Test CSRF token validation\n    const response = await this.page.request.post('/api/data', {\n      data: { test: 'data' },\n      headers: { 'X-CSRF-Token': 'invalid-token' },\n    });\n\n    expect(response.status()).toBe(403);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Accessibility Testing\n\n```typescript\n// Accessibility testing with Playwright\nclass AccessibilityTester {\n  constructor(private page: Page) {}\n\n  async testKeyboardNavigation(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    // Test tab navigation\n    await this.page.keyboard.press('Tab');\n    await expect(this.page.locator(':focus')).toBeVisible();\n\n    // Test enter key functionality\n    await this.page.keyboard.press('Enter');\n    // Verify expected action occurred\n  }\n\n  async testScreenReaderCompatibility(): Promise\u003Cvoid> {\n    // Test ARIA labels\n    const elementsWithAria = await this.page.locator('[aria-label]').count();\n    expect(elementsWithAria).toBeGreaterThan(0);\n\n    // Test alt text for images\n    const imagesWithoutAlt = await this.page.locator('img:not([alt])').count();\n    expect(imagesWithoutAlt).toBe(0);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdvanced Playwright testing requires a combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and practical experience. The strategies outlined above have been proven effective in complex enterprise environments, particularly in European Commission projects where reliability and compliance are paramount.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- **Architecture matters**: Use Page Object Model and proper TypeScript typing\n- **Data management**: Implement robust test data factories\n- **Error handling**: Build resilience into your test suite\n- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize test execution\n- **Security**: Include security testing in your automation\n- **Accessibility**: Ensure your applications work for all users\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to automate testing, but to create a reliable, maintainable, and scalable testing framework that supports continuous delivery and quality assurance.\n\n---\n\n_What advanced Playwright techniques have you found most valuable in your projects?

And yet, most Capoeira groups still rely on scattered Facebook posts, outdated websites, and word-of-mouth to share events and news.\n\nI wanted to create something better:\n\n- A central, multilingual hub for events, posts, and media.\n- A system that could scale from a local group to an international audience.\n- A platform that respects Capoeira’s traditions but also meets modern UX and technical standards.\n\nI knew from day one this wouldn’t just be a “website.” It would be a custom CMS, tailored for the rhythms and workflows of Capoeira.\n\n## The Technology Stack — and Why I Chose It\n\nThe stack had to be modern, maintainable, and future-proof without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 18.3 (Server Components by default).\n  - **Why**: Server-first rendering for performance, SEO, and cleaner data fetching.\n- **Database & Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage) with Prisma ORM.\n  - **Why**: SQL reliability + Prisma’s type safety + Supabase’s storage for media.\n- **Auth**: NextAuth.js v5 (JWT-based sessions).\n  - **Why**: Flexible, secure, and well-documented for role-based control.\n- **UI**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI + Radix Primitives.\n  - **Why**: Consistent design system, accessibility built-in, rapid iteration.\n- **Validation**: Zod on both frontend and backend.\n  - **Why**: Single source of truth for input rules.\n- **Email**: Resend API with React Email templates.\n  - **Why**: Customizable transactional emails in multiple languages.\n- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright for unit, API, and E2E.\n  - **Why**: Confidence in core flows (especially event registration).\n- **CMS Platform**: Custom-built admin panel at `/admin` with role-based access.\n  - **Why**: Off-the-shelf CMSs (WordPress, Strapi) couldn’t match the tailored i18n and event/media workflows we needed.\n\nThis wasn’t just “the tech I like” — each choice was deliberate to balance performance, maintainability, and cultural requirements.\n\n## The CMS: Where the Magic Happens\n\nThe public site might be the face of the Portal, but the real heart is the custom CMS I built for the teaching team.\n\n### Core CMS Features\n\n- **Events Manager**: Create, edit, publish/unpublish events; configure registration options; upload cover images; attach albums.\n- **Posts Manager**: Rich text editor (TipTap) with embedded media, multilingual content creation, and tags.\n- **Media Manager**: Batch uploads, drag-and-drop, cover selection, metadata editing, and event/post association.\n- **Newsletter Manager**: Subscriber database, campaign creation, analytics.\n- **User & Role Management**: Invite-only access, ADMIN/MODERATOR roles.\n\n### What Makes It Different\n\n- **Progressive Translation UI**: English content is required, other languages are optional and can be added gradually — perfect for a small admin team.\n- **Cultural Alignment**: The forms, terminology, and data structures are tailored to how Capoeira events actually work (multi-day attendance, T-shirts, meals, etc.).\n- **Role-based Safety**: The wrong person can’t accidentally wipe out all event data.\n\nI wasn’t just building a “back office” — I was crafting an instrument that mestres and moderators could actually enjoy playing.\n\n## The Hardest Challenges (and How I Solved Them)\n\n### 1. True Multilingual Architecturei18n\n\nThe i18n requirements went far beyond a few translated strings.\nEvery piece of content — events, posts, albums — needed:\n\n- A default (English) version.\n- Optional translations in 3 more languages.\n- Automatic fallback to the best available language.\n\nThe trap: Most CMSs store translations inline, which quickly gets messy.\n\n**My solution:**\nSeparate translation tables in the database (EventTranslation, PostTranslation, MediaAlbumTranslation) with unique constraints and a clean resolution function. This keeps queries fast and fallback logic consistent.\n\n### 2. Media Uploads Without Painmedia\n\nEvents without photos feel incomplete. But uploading and organizing media can be a nightmare for non-technical users.\n\nThe trap: Upload workflows that block content creation until every file is perfect.\n\n**My solution:**\n\n- Immediate cover image upload with preview.\n- Batch media uploads after album creation, with progress bars and error feedback.\n- Supabase Storage with strict RLS policies to keep public and private media separate.\n\n### 3. Event Registration Logic That Adaptsevents\n\nCapoeira events can be wildly different — a one-day kids’ workshop, a week-long international festival, or anything in between.\n\nThe trap: Hardcoding a “one-size-fits-all” registration form.\n\n**My solution:**\n\n- Dynamic form generation based on event config.\n- Conditional Zod validation that changes per event.\n- Built-in constraints like one registration per email per event.\n\n### 4. Building Alone Means Owning Everything\n\nEvery bug, every deployment, every database migration — it’s all on me.\n\nThis meant:\n\n- Writing tests before features for critical flows.\n- Keeping strict commit discipline (small, meaningful commits with clear messages).\n- Automating backups so I could sleep at night.\n- Documenting every decision in `/docs/` so future contributors (or future me) wouldn’t be lost.\n\n## Security and Ops: My Invisible Work\n\nUsers never see it, but a lot of my time went into:\n\n- Middleware that protects admin routes and enforces rolesauth.\n- Rate-limiting public forms to prevent spam.\n- Structured logging with context for every requestoperations.\n- Blue-green deployment so updates happen without downtime.\n- Daily database backups + weekly media backups with encryption.\n\n## Reflections as a Solo Developer\n\nBuilding this was both exhilarating and exhausting.\nThere were nights where I stared at Prisma migration errors for hours. Days spent debugging why a Supabase storage policy wasn’t behaving. And the endless balancing act between what’s perfect and what ships.\n\nBut when I saw the first public user register for an event in Greek, get their confirmation email in Portuguese, and browse an event gallery in German — it hit me:\nThis wasn’t just a website. It was a living, breathing digital roda.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe Casa Capoeira Portal is now live, fast, secure, multilingual, and easy to use — for both our community and the small admin team that keeps it running.\n\nAs a solo developer, this project taught me how to:\n\n- Balance cultural authenticity with technical excellence.\n- Build a custom CMS that fits a niche better than any off-the-shelf option.\n- Manage scope, performance, and security without a safety net.\n\nAnd most importantly — that building software for a community you love is the most rewarding work there is.","src/content/blog/casa-capoeira-journey.mdx","3ff66b3519986369","casa-capoeira-journey.mdx","projects",["Map",107,108,196,197],"casa-capoeira",{"id":107,"data":109,"body":154,"filePath":155,"digest":156,"rendered":157,"legacyId":195},{"title":110,"description":111,"excerpt":112,"coverImage":75,"coverVideo":113,"tags":114,"techStack":119,"featured":26,"publishedAt":127,"updatedAt":128,"client":129,"duration":130,"role":131,"team":132,"problem":133,"solution":134,"impact":135,"challenges":136,"learnings":141,"liveUrl":146,"githubUrl":147,"status":148,"featuredImage":149,"gallery":150},"Casa Capoeira","A comprehensive CMS platform for capoeira schools and academies, streamlining class management, student enrollment, and community engagement.","Modern CMS platform revolutionizing how capoeira schools manage their operations and engage with students.","/videos/casa-capoeira-preview.mp4",[90,115,116,117,118],"Education","Community","Full-Stack","SaaS",[120,121,54,122,123,124,83,125,126,86,87,88,50],"Next.js 15","React 18","Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)","Prisma ORM","NextAuth v5","ShadCN UI","Radix Primitives","2025-08-01","2025-08-02","Capoeira Community","6 months","Full-Stack Developer & Product Designer",[18],"Capoeira schools struggle with manual class scheduling, student management, and community engagement.
